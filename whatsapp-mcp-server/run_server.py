"""Per-user launcher: supervise the Go bridge, then run the MCP server (stdio).

This is the single process the mcp-auth-wrapper spawns per authenticated user.
It owns the Go bridge's lifecycle directly in Python — far more robust than a
bash entrypoint, which couldn't both exec the server AND reap the bridge.

Design:
  - Derive a store dir from MCP_USER_ID, plus MCP_PROFILE_ID when the wrapper
    binds a connection to one of several accounts, and a deterministic loopback
    port from that store dir.
  - Start the Go bridge as a child, set the env the MCP server reads at import.
  - On exit (idle-reap, crash, signal) the bridge is terminated with us — an
    atexit hook plus a try/finally around mcp.run() (which anyio unwinds on
    SIGTERM/SIGINT) guarantee no orphan keeps holding the port.
  - The bridge's stdout/stderr go to OUR stderr, keeping stdout clean for the MCP
    stdio JSON-RPC channel.
